# SwingAudioPlayer
My First Swing UI application in Java that helps you play the basic audio file formats without any additional libraries and lets you play sequence, save as and open playlists
My Little Java Swing experimentation with the audio features without using any external libraries to support playing low memory audio formats with
 ability to save playlists shuffle through them and play/pause etc.
Detailed documentation coming soon.
